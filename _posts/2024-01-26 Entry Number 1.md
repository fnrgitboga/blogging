I stopped writing a while ago. I am going to figure out why. I wrote a lot of different types of pieces. I recall doing copywriting, writing for magazines (e.g., inspirational pieces), short stories, erotica, and documenting my daily life.  
  
I enjoyed the freedom that writing gave me, but I did not like how I wrote. I write too much like I speak, and that got me a lot of criticism and negative feedback from those I asked to be reviewers of my pieces. I think this might have caused my rejection sensitivity dysphoria (RSD) to flare up and completely put me off writing altogether. I also worried too much about how my audience would perceive my writing and, in turn, perceive me. My writing is also long-winded and flowery, and that tends to put people off (inferring from the feedback I received). I am not good at concisely expressing myself without intense scrutiny and proofreading, and that tends to make me not want to write because I feel the sense of unbridled freedom diminish significantly.Â 

I hope that with this habit of practising writing with my partner, I rediscover the comfort I found in writing. I will aim to create a blog on which I will publish my work and eventually publish a collection or a book.  
  
I have found my purpose.

P.S. Feedback appreciated!
